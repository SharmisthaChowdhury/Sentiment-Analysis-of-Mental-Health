# Sentiment Analysis of Mental Health

This repository performs sentiment analysis on mental health data using multiple algorithms, including Logistic Regression, SVC, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. The project covers text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is hosted on Kaggle. You can download it from the following link:

[Download Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sharmisthac/combined-data-csv)

After downloading, please place the dataset in the appropriate directory in the project (e.g., `data/`).

## Features

- Text preprocessing (removal of stop words, punctuation, etc.)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Training multiple machine learning models
- Evaluation of model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Visualization of results using graphs and charts

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Mental-Health.git
